Hello evrybody,
my solution is pretty straight forward:

CertUtil -hashfile "C:\User ... linuxmint64.iso" SHA256 > checksum.txt //Calculate the hash checksum of our iso file and store the result in a file

//Now you should check the file to see the hashcode which is on the 2nd line.
$x = Get-Content "C:\User\...checksum.txt" //store content on a variable

//Download the sha256sum.txt from the website and store the content in a varibale
$y = Get-Content "C:\User\...sha256sum.txt"

//Now we gotta extract the hash code of our specific version of Linux Mint (18.3 64bit for me! :D)
$a = $y[1].Substring(0,64) //Extract the first 64 character of the second line

$x[1] -eq $a //If it returns TRUE then you're all set!
